### Data description
* `afdb_cluster_stats.RDS` is an overview of Foldseek cluster statistics. More details [here](https://afdb-cluster.steineggerlab.workers.dev/). <br>
* `afdb_cluster_taxonomy.RDS` contains taxonomic ranks for each species in the AFDB (collected from the [NCBI taxonomy database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). Column order: <br>

  ```Species | Genus | Family | Order | Class | Phylum | Kingdom | Superkingdom/domain | NCBI taxonomic id |```  <br>

* `afdb_genome_size_stats.RDS` contains genome statistics for each species in the AFDB (collected from the [NCBI genome database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). Column order: <br>

  ```Organism | NCBI taxonomic ID | Genome size | GC% | # genes | # proteins |```  <br>
