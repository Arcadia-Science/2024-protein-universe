## Data

### Contents

Contained are all data necessary to reproduce the analyses in `code/protein-universe-analysis.R`. Data are contained in pre-processed .RDS files generated by `code/protein-universe-data.R`. Refer to `code/protein-universe-data.R` and the pub for more information on how data were collected and processed.  

### Data description
* `afdb_cluster_stats.RDS` is an overview of Foldseek cluster statistics. More details [here](https://afdb-cluster.steineggerlab.workers.dev/). <br>
* `afdb_cluster_taxonomy.RDS` contains taxonomic ranks for each species in the AFDB (collected from the [NCBI taxonomy database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). Column order: <br>

  ```Species | Genus | Family | Order | Class | Phylum | Kingdom | Superkingdom/domain | NCBI taxonomic id |```  <br>

* `afdb_genome_size_stats.RDS` contains genome statistics for each species in the AFDB (collected from the [NCBI genome database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). Column order: <br>

  ```Organism | NCBI taxonomic ID | Genome size | GC% | # genes | # proteins |```  <br>

* `pdb_metadata.RDS` contains the number of protein structures per species in the [Protein Data Bank](www.rcsb.org/stats/explore/scientific_name_of_source_organism). <br>
* `pdb_taxonomy.RDS` contains taxonomic ranks for each species in the PDB. Format is the same as `afdb_cluster_taxonomy.RDS`. <br>
* `timetree_phylogeny_cleaned.RDS` is a Newick file of the [timetree.org](https://timetree.org/) phylogeny. <br>
* `timetree_taxonomy.RDS` contains taxonomic ranks for each species in the Timetree phylogeny. Format is the same as `afdb_cluster_taxonomy.RDS`. <br>
